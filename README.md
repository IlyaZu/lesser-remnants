# Lesser Remnants

The commonly agreed brilliant thing about the original game is its simplicity and elegance, yet most 4X games since have only added features.
This is understandable, as feature removals aren't exactly an exciting thing to put on the back of the box.
Fortunately, this is a hobbyist endeavour free of such constraints!
As such, the project aims to answer "What if Remnants of the Precursors but less?" in gory detail.

Expect mostly removals from code, UI, story and game mechanics. 
If not removed, an attempt will be made to tweak the afore mentioned to simply work better.
No new features are planned!
