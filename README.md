# Lesser Remnants

## Overview

The commonly agreed brilliant thing about the original game is its simplicity and elegance, yet most 4X games since have only added features.
This is understandable, as feature removals aren't exactly an exciting thing to put on the back of the box.
Fortunately, this is a hobbyist endeavour free of such constraints!
As such, the project aims to answer "What if Remnants of the Precursors but less?" in gory detail.

Expect mostly removals from code, UI, story and game mechanics. 
If not removed, an attempt will be made to tweak the afore mentioned to simply work better.
No new features are planned!

## Stability

While every commit should represent a working, slightly improved, version of the game no attempt is made to make saves backwards compatible.
In fact, I know I have already broken save compatibility many times. 
This is a necessary sacrifice to make the kind of changes I want to make.
If you are playing this game as changes come out, consider finishing a session before pulling changes.

There is currently no built, pre-packaged distribution of this game. 
If you want to play it, you will have to pull the code and compile it yourself.
I have no objections to others building and distributing game.
In fact, this is your legal right!
